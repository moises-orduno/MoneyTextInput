# What is it?
MoneyTextInput allows you to create a textinput with a money mask.

#How to use it?
##Essentials

####Setting up

The TextInput has a default setting for american dollar currency $, so just call it as any other native android component.

```java
MoneyTextInput moneyTextInput;

 moneyTextInput=(MoneyTextInput)findViewById(R.id.money_text_input);
```

Create its xml with the properties you need

```java
    <com.moises.moneytextinput.textInput.MoneyTextInput
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:id="@+id/money_text_input" />
```



####Changing the Symbol

The symbol in front of the amount can be change to others already set in default

- ```moneyTextInput.setSymbol(Constants.POUND);```

If you need a different symbol from the ones I have, make me know, I may update the project, or you can use the method to use your own.

```java
  moneyTextInput1.setSideTextNoSymbol("Money ");
```


####Changing the settings

You can obtain the values from the TextInput as wheter the value is 0, the value with cents or the value with no cents, it's returned as a String.

- ```moneyTextInput.isValueEmpty();```
- ```moneyTextInput.bringCleanAmount();```
- ```moneyTextInput.bringCleanAmountNoCents();```

You can change if you want to use cents or not, or only whole numbers, the method has values set in default

- ```moneyTextInput.setState(Constants.WHOLE_NO_CENTS);```
